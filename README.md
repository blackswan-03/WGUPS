A Python project that I developed for my WGU Data Structures and Algorimths class. It consists of a hypothetical scenario where three delivery trucks need to deliver all their packages across the Salt Lake City area by a certain time. Additional requirements are added to certain packages that increase the difficulty of the delivery process and as a result, create greater code complexity. The code implements a simple "nearest-neighbor" algorithm to allow for the trucks to deliver the packages in time without resulting in unreasonable code complexity or route calculation times. A custom HashMap was also created to contain and keep track of the packages.
