A Python project that I developed for my WGU Data Structures and Algorimths class. It consists of a hypothetical scenario where three delivery trucks need to deliver all their packages across the Salt Lake City area by their programmed delivery date. Additional requirements are added to certain packages that increase the complexity of the delivery process and as a result, create greater code complexity.
